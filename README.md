# Abstract

In this paper we study upwelling pathways and timescales of Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) in a hierarchy of models using a Lagrangian particle tracking method. Lagrangian timescales of CDW upwelling shorten from 87 years to 31 years to 17 years as the ocean resolution is refined from 1° to 0.25° to 0.1°. We attribute the majority of the differences in timescale to the strength of the eddy fields, as demonstrated by temporally degrading high resolution model velocity fields. Consistent with the timescale dependence, we find that an average Lagrangian particle completes 3.2 circumpolar loops in the 1° model in comparison to 0.9 loops in the 0.1° model. These differences suggest that advective timescales and thus inter-basin merging of upwelling CDW may be overestimated by coarse resolution models, potentially affecting the skill of centennial scale climate change projections
